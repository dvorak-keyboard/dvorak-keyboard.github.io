I will no tell the long stroy,just my settings for keyboard,may not suitable for
evereyone, but hope someone will like it and enjoy it.

Most frequently used modifed keys in Emacs are ~C~ and ~M~ (~C~ is Ctrl, ~M~ is
Alt),to avoiding pinky hurt,we need to remapping ~C~ and ~M~ to somewhere
else.First you may need to learn about what is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_key#Dual-role_keys][Dual Role Key]].

We know that HHKB use Capslock as Ctrl,so we follow it,symmetrically,we use
Enter as a Ctrl too,so the Enter is a dual role key,when hold it,acting as
Ctrl,when tap,acting as Enter, knowing that we lost abillty that when hold Enter
key,we can't not send contious Enter keys, now come with Alt key,you may got the
ideas? aren't you? make Tab as a dual role,When hold it, acting as Alt,tap as
Tab key. so backslash key has the same function.

so come the biggest problem,what is the best way the make these settings working
on my keyborad,software or hardware,I suggest that buy a harware programmble
keyboard,try search gh60 on Google,and and you will find some other keyboard
like this,which is eaisly do the trick above.

I keep the origin Ctrl and Alt there,for compaitble reason,other people can use
my keyborad as normal,and do whatever you like to set these key to other keys.


| key       | hold | tap       |
|-----------+------+-----------|
| Caps Lock | Ctrl | None      |
| Enter     | Ctrl | Enter     |
| Tab       | Alt  | Tab       |
| Backslash | Alt  | BackSlash |

I also put a trick on shift,try read something about space cadet shift,i first
use it for my keyborad,but easliy getting woring inputing in vim and emacs,then
I make it act as like,when tap it,act as a lead key,hold for Shift,after tap
it,when you tap r,you will get ~(~,tap ~u~,you will get ~)~,the ~r~, ~u~ are on
QWERTY layout position,and I put ~{~ in ~f~, ~}~ in ~j~, ~[~ in ~v~, ~]~ in
~m~,you can try your one's,if you have the keyborad I metioned,see table below
for more clear understading.

| key | map |
|-----+-----|
|  r  |  (  |
|  u  |  )  |
|  f  |  {  |
|  h  |  }  |
|  v  |  [  |
|  m  |  ]  |

there is a [[https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51069.0][spacefn]] layout out there,similar to [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]],use space as a lead
key,you can combine this,make your typing life better,actullay these setting
have no much association about Dvorak layout,but I suggest use it,there is a lot
good reason people said,I found it very suitable for Emacs.
